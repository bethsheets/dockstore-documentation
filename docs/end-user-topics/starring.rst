Starring Tools and Workflows
============================

If you find a tool or a workflow interesting and want to keep track of
it, you can star it. You can see all of your starred entries on the
`starred page <https://dockstore.org/starred>`__. This is in the account
dropdown on the top right of the page.

How To Star an Entry
--------------------

To star an entry, go to the public page of a tool or workflow and click
on the star button. Beside the star is another button which shows the
number of users who have also starred the entry. Clicking on the button
will bring you to a page where you can view all the users who have also
starred the entry.

Other Reasons To Star an Entry
------------------------------

Starring also gives an indication for how popular a tool or workflow is.
When searching for tools and workflows you can sort by the number of
stars. This means that starring is a good way to tell developers that
you like their tool or workflow. This also tells the community that the
entry is likely of better quality.
