Public and Private Dockstore Tools
==================================

Most tool creators want public access to their tools, however some might
want to restrict access to running the tool.

A ``public Dockstore tool`` is a tool which does not require
authentication to view on the Docker registry's website or to pull the
Docker image. It is freely available for anyone to use.

A ``private Dockstore tool`` is a tool which requires authentication to
view on the Docker registry's website (if it exists) and to pull the
Docker image. A user interested in using a private tool must select the
``Request Access`` button found on the tool's Dockstore entry. Doing so
will create an email to the tool maintainer that will be sent from the
user's email client. **The user must include their username for the
Docker registry of interest**. It is then the responsibility of the tool
maintainer to give the user permission to view/pull the docker image.

It is important to note that descriptor files and tool metadata will be
visible to other users when the tool is published. This is in order to
make others aware of your tool. However, tool creators will be
responsible for managing sharing of Docker images, and they will not be
available to others without authentication.
