Dockstore parses metadata and allows it to be used in Dockstore search
which helps others find your tool/workflow more easily. "Author" is one
of the metadata fields that is searchable:

   :alt: search-metadata

   search-metadata

Additionally, metadata is displayed in the tool/workflow's "Info" tab.
The highlighted sections below will appear once metadata is added to the
descriptor:

.. figure:: /assets/images/docs/best_practices/info-tab-metadata.png
   :alt: info-tab-metadata

   info-tab-metadata

For all developers, we highly recommend the following minimal metadata
for your tools and workflows.
