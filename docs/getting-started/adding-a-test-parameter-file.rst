We are able to register the above input parameterization of the tool
into Dockstore so that users can see and test an example with our tool.
Users can manually add test parameter files for a given tool tag or
workflow version through both the command line and the versions tab in
the UI.

.. tip::  Make sure that any required input files are given as publically
    accessible URLs so that a user can run the example successfully.
